See the Details Page before Doing Development and Update the Instruction if Any .

Basic Description:
->This is a technical blueprint for building a gold price comparison website specifically for Singapore. The main idea is to create a platform where people can easily compare gold prices (916 and 999 types) from different jewelry shops across Singapore in one place, similar to how you might compare prices on shopping websites. Regular users would be able to search for shops, view current prices, see shop locations on a map, and track price trends over time through charts. Shop owners and administrators would have special login access to update their store information and gold prices. The website would be designed to work well on both phones and computers, with real-time price updates and compliance with Singapore's data protection laws. The document outlines a detailed development plan that involves creating a database to store shop and price information, building the backend system to handle data, creating the user-friendly website interface, and connecting everything together. Essentially, it's a comprehensive plan to build a "one-stop shop" website that saves people time by letting them compare gold prices from multiple jewelry stores without having to visit each shop individually or make multiple phone calls.

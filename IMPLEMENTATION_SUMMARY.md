# Gold Shop Application - Implementation Summary

## üè† HOME PAGE UPDATES

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Load Behavior
- **Implemented**: Load all shops sorted by lowest gold price (916 or 999 by default) then by nearest distance
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `sortByPriceThenDistance()` function that sorts shops by minimum price first, then by distance
  - Changed default sort from 'name' to 'price-distance'
  - Updated initial load logic to use the new sorting function
  - Added "Best Price & Distance" option to sort dropdown

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ After User Clicks "Search"
- **Implemented**: Load matching shops sorted in the same way (lowest gold price then nearest distance)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Modified `handleSearch()` to automatically apply price-distance sorting after search
  - Ensured both sortings are applied together on page load and after search

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Show More/Less Button Logic
- **Implemented**: Remove "Show More" / "Show Less" buttons when total results ‚â§ 8
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `showMoreVisible` state to control button visibility
  - Updated logic: `setShowMoreVisible(filtered.length > 8 && filtered.length > displayedShops)`
  - Wrapped Show More/Less buttons with conditional rendering

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Search Suggestion Selection
- **Implemented**: When user left-clicks on a suggestion, it instantly fills the search bar
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `handleSuggestionClick()` to immediately set search term
  - Maintained hover and active styles for suggestions
  - Search is not automatically triggered - waits for Search button click

## üè¨ ALL SHOP PAGE UPDATES

### üîÑ Pagination Logic
- **Implemented**: After user performs search, if result count ‚â§ 12, do not display Show More / Show Less buttons
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `showMoreVisible` state to AllShops page
  - Updated pagination logic: `if (hasSearched && filtered.length <= 12) { setShowMoreVisible(false) }`
  - Default view (no search) can still show Show More / Show Less if applicable

### üí° Shared Logic for Both Pages
- **Search Suggestion Selection**: Works consistently across both Home Page and All Shop Page
- **Nearby Me Button**: Cross-page functionality implemented

## üìç NEARBY ME BUTTON (Cross-page Logic)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Behavior
- **Implemented**: When user clicks the Nearby Me button:
  - Opens a small container with an input box
  - User types in a location ‚Üí clicks OK / Search / Done
  - Input is copied into the main search bar on both Home and All Shop pages
  - Immediately triggers a search using that location
  - Filters and shows shops sorted by nearest distance

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Toggle Logic
- **Implemented**: If Nearby Me button is clicked again, deactivate it
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added toggle functionality to `handleNearbyMe()`
  - On deactivation: clears nearby state and returns pages to default behavior
  - Button shows "Nearby Active" when active, "Nearby Me" when inactive

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Featured Title Bug
- **Implemented**: When Nearby Me is active and user clears the search bar:
  - Does NOT display: "Gold Shops Near """
  - Instead shows graceful fallback titles:
    - Home page: "Gold Shops Across Singapore" with subtitle "sorted by lowest price and nearest distance"
    - All Shops page: "All Gold Shops" with subtitle "with competitive gold prices"

## üõç SHOP PAGE FEATURE ‚Äì ADD REVIEW

### üìù Add Review Logic
- **Implemented**: On Shop Detail Page:
  - Added "Add Review" button in Reviews tab
  - Form includes:

    - Textarea for Feedback (required, min 10 characters)
    - Rating selector (1‚Äì5 stars, interactive)
    - Submit button labeled "Submit Review"
    - Cancel button to close form

### Form Validation & Submission
- **Implemented**:
  - Validates all fields before submission
  - Shows error messages for invalid inputs
  - Adds the review to the current shop's review list
  - Resets the form after successful submission
  - New reviews appear at the top of the list with "Just now" timestamp

### UI Features
- **Interactive Rating Selector**: Click stars to set rating (1-5)
- **Form Validation**: Real-time error clearing when user starts typing
- **Responsive Design**: Form adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the existing dark theme with yellow accents

## üì± RESPONSIVENESS & UI NOTES
